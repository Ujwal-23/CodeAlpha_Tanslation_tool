It looks like you've deployed your project, but if you're seeing the README instead of your webpage, here are a few troubleshooting steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Verify the File Structure
Make sure your repository has the following structure:

graphql
Copy code
/CodeAlpha_Translation_tool
  ├── index.html   # This should be your main HTML file
  ├── script.js     # Your JavaScript file
  ├── styles.css    # Your CSS file
  ├── images/       # Directory for images (if used)
  ├── README.md     # Your README file
2. Rename Your HTML File
Ensure that your main HTML file is named index.html. GitHub Pages serves index.html as the default file.
3. Check GitHub Pages Settings
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click on the Settings tab.
Scroll down to the Pages section.
Ensure that the source branch is set to main or master and that the root (/) is selected as the folder.
4. Clear Browser Cache
Sometimes, your browser may cache old versions of your site. Clear your cache or try opening the site in an incognito window.

5. Use Correct URLs for Assets
Make sure that all your asset links (CSS, JS, images) are correct in index.html. They should be relative paths like this:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
6. Wait for Deployment
After making changes, it may take a few minutes for the changes to propagate on GitHub Pages.

7. Check for Errors in Developer Console
Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect).
Look at the Console and Network tabs for any errors that might indicate what's going wrong.
8. Confirm Accessibility of index.html
To confirm that your index.html is being served, you can try accessing it directly by going to:

bash
Copy code
https://ujwal-23.github.io/CodeAlpha_Translation_tool/index.html
If the page loads correctly with this URL, but not at the root URL, it suggests that GitHub Pages is not configured to serve index.html as the default page.

Conclusion
After following these steps, your webpage should display instead of the README. If the problem persists, please share any error messages you find in the developer console or other details, and I can assist further!
